# Support Vector Machines (SVM) Project - Wine Fraud Detection

![Wine Fraud](wine.jpg)

## Introduction

Wine fraud is a significant issue in the wine industry, with deceptive practices such as adulteration and relabelling of inferior wines as premium brands. In this project, we aim to leverage machine learning techniques, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVM), to detect fraudulent wine samples based on various chemical features.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this project is sourced from a study titled "Modeling wine preferences by data mining from physicochemical properties" by P. Cortez, A. Cerdeira, F. Almeida, T. Matos, and J. Reis (2009). It includes physicochemical properties of wine samples, which we will use to classify wines as either "Legit" or "Fraud."

## Project Goals

- Build a machine learning model using SVM to classify wine samples as "Legit" or "Fraud."
- Evaluate the model's performance using various metrics.
- Provide insights and recommendations for detecting wine fraud.

## Project Execution

The project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Loading and preprocessing the dataset, including feature scaling.

2. **Model Training**: Training an SVM model with a linear kernel.

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tuning the model's hyperparameters using GridSearchCV to optimize performance.

4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results and Insights

The project aims to provide insights into the effectiveness of using SVM for wine fraud detection. The classification report, including precision, recall, and F1-score, will be generated to assess the model's performance.

## Usage

You can replicate this project by running the provided Python scripts and using the dataset (`wine_fraud.csv`). Make sure you have the required libraries and dependencies installed.

## Conclusion

Wine fraud detection is a crucial task in the wine industry to ensure the authenticity and quality of products. Leveraging SVM and machine learning can assist in automating the detection process and mitigating the risks associated with wine fraud.
